## 📖 Overview

Welcome to my centralized hub for **Software Development Engineering (SDE) and Artificial Intelligence** interview preparation. 

This repository documents my journey in mastering the full stack of modern engineering—from optimizing algorithmic efficiency (DSA) and architecting scalable systems, to training Neural Networks and building GenAI applications.

## 🗝️ Key Focus Areas

### 1. Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)

* **Core:** Focus on Time & Space Complexity (Big O).
* **Patterns:** Mastering patterns like *Sliding Window*, *Fast & Slow Pointers*, and *Merge Intervals* rather than memorizing code.
* **Python Specifics:** Utilizing `collections`, `heapq`, and `itertools` for efficient coding.

### 2. Software Design & Architecture

* **Object-Oriented Design (LLD):** Applying SOLID principles to design problems (e.g., "Design a Parking Lot").
* **System Design (HLD):** Understanding Load Balancers, Caching (Redis), Sharding, and CAP Theorem.
* **Backend:** Writing clean, testable API endpoints using FastAPI/Flask.

### 3. AI & Data Science

* **ML Ops:** From training models in Jupyter Notebooks to deploying them as microservices.
* **GenAI:** Building practical applications using OpenAI APIs and open-source LLMs (Llama, Mistral).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools

* **Languages:** Python (Primary), SQL
* **Libraries:** NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow
* **GenAI:** LangChain, Hugging Face, OpenAI
* **Backend:** FastAPI, Flask, Docker, PostgreSQL

## 💻 How to Run

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/[YOUR_USERNAME]/[REPO_NAME].git
```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Run a specific script:**
```bash
python DSA_&_Algorithms/Arrays_Strings/two_sum.py
```

## 📝 Keep Hustling

**"The expert in anything was once a beginner who refused to give up."** 
 
**Keep grinding. Every line of code, every solved problem, every debugged error is a step closer to mastery. 🚀**
